## Terraform Exercise - Project Structure

### Project Description

Imagine you are working on developing a static website and you need to define the directory structure and some local files to organize your project. Use Terraform to manage this structure.

### Requirements

1. **Directory Structure:**
   - Create a local resource that represents the main project directory named "my_website".
   - Within this directory, create two subdirectories: "assets" and "pages".

2. **"assets" Directory:**
   - Create a local resource that represents the "assets" directory.
   - Inside "assets", create two subdirectories: "css" and "js".

3. **"pages" Directory:**
   - Create a local resource that represents the "pages" directory.
   - Inside "pages", create two HTML files: "index.html" and "about.html".
   - Define basic content for each HTML file.

### Constraints

- Use local resources to define the project structure.
- Customize the names of the directories and files as directed.
- Ensure that the final structure reflects the organization mentioned in the project description.

### Instructions

1. Create a `main.tf` file with the Terraform configuration.
2. Run `terraform init and plan` to initialize the working directory.
3. Execute `terraform apply` to apply the configuration and create the project structure.
4. Verify that the directory and file structure has been correctly created.
5. Document your code and the purpose of each local resource used.
